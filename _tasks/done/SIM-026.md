# SIM-026: Spawn agent subprocess in GCP simulator (Cloud Run RunJob)

**Status:** DONE
**Effort:** M

## What Changed

When a Cloud Run Job execution starts and the job env contains
`SOCKERLESS_AGENT_CALLBACK_URL`, the GCP simulator spawns the agent subprocess.
Agent-managed executions skip auto-complete. Agents are cleaned up on cancel
execution and delete job.

## Files Modified

- `simulators/gcp/cloudrunjobs.go` — Added `crjAgentProcs sync.Map`, agent spawn
  in RunJob handler, cleanup in cancel/delete handlers, helper functions
  `crjGetAgentCallbackURL`, `crjStartAgentProcess`, `crjStopAgentProcess`
