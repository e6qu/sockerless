# P52-002 — GitHub E2E Workflows (23→31)

**Status:** Done
**Date:** 2026-02-23

## What Changed
- Created 8 new workflow `.yml` files in `tests/e2e-live-tests/github-runner/workflows/`
- Added `services-http` (from Phase 51) + 8 new names to `ALL_WORKFLOWS` in `run.sh`
- Added `services-http` variant routing in `lib.sh` (→ `services-wasm` on memory/FaaS)

## New Workflows
| File | What It Exercises |
|------|-------------------|
| container-options.yml | `container.options: --user root` — HostConfig fields |
| container-env-create.yml | `container.env:` — env merging (container + job + step) |
| diamond-deps.yml | 4-job diamond dependency graph — concurrent lifecycle |
| matrix-multi.yml | 2×2 matrix — parallel container name uniqueness |
| conditional-job.yml | Job-level `if: ${{ false }}` — skipped job |
| continue-on-error.yml | `continue-on-error: true` — non-zero exec continues |
| timeout-job.yml | `timeout-minutes: 5` — job timeout parsing |
| working-dir-nested.yml | `defaults.run.working-directory` — nested dirs |
