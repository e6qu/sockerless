# SIM-023: Add reverse agent to CloudRun backend

**Status:** DONE
**Effort:** M

## What Changed

Added reverse agent support to the CloudRun backend. Same pattern as ECS (SIM-022):
- `jobspec.go`: Callback entrypoint + env vars in Cloud Run Job protobuf
- `containers.go`: IsTailDevNull early return, Prepare/WaitForAgent/WaitForDisconnect,
  AgentRegistry.Remove in kill/remove handlers
- Added `waitForExecutionComplete` helper (polls GetExecution for CompletionTime)

## Files Modified

- `backends/cloudrun/jobspec.go` — Callback mode for job spec
- `backends/cloudrun/containers.go` — Reverse agent flow + execution completion helper
