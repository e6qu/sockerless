# P66-003: Frontend Middleware + Context Propagation

**Status:** Done
**Phase:** 66 — OpenTelemetry Tracing

## What
Added `otelhttp.NewHandler` middleware to frontend server.go. Rewrote `backend_client.go`: all 11 HTTP methods gained `ctx context.Context` as first parameter, changed from `httpClient.Get/Post` to `http.NewRequestWithContext + httpClient.Do`. Transport wrapped with `otelhttp.NewTransport` for W3C Trace Context propagation.

Updated 56 call sites across 8 frontend handler files (containers.go, containers_stream.go, exec.go, images.go, networks.go, volumes.go, pods.go, system.go) to pass `r.Context()`.

## Tests
7 frontend tests PASS.
