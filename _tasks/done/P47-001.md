# P47-001: CLI Module

**Status:** Done

Created `cmd/sockerless/` standalone Go module with zero external dependencies. Four files: `main.go` (subcommand dispatch), `context.go` (6 context CRUD operations), `paths.go` (path helpers with `SOCKERLESS_HOME` override), `go.mod`. Added to `go.work`.

Subcommands: `context create` (with `--backend` + repeatable `--set KEY=VALUE`), `context list` (marks active with `*`), `context show`, `context use`, `context delete`, `context current`. Config stored as `~/.sockerless/contexts/{name}/config.json`. Active context in `~/.sockerless/active`.

CLI builds and all operations verified end-to-end.
