# P72-003: ACA Arithmetic Integration Tests

**Phase**: 72 (Full-Stack E2E Tests)
**Status**: ✅ Complete

## What
Added 6 arithmetic evaluator integration tests to `backends/aca/`. Applied same fast-exit fix as CloudRun. Uses soft log assertions via `checkLogs` helper because Azure `azquery` SDK refuses HTTP credentials.

## Files
- `backends/aca/arithmetic_integration_test.go` — new (6 tests)
- `backends/aca/integration_test.go` — modified (eval binary build in TestMain, SOCKERLESS_ACA_LOG_ANALYTICS_WORKSPACE env)
- `backends/aca/containers.go` — modified (fast-exit path)
