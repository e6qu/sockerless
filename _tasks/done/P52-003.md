# P52-003 — GitLab E2E Pipelines (22→26)

**Status:** Done
**Date:** 2026-02-23

## What Changed
- Created 4 new pipeline `.yml` files in `tests/e2e-live-tests/gitlab-runner-docker/pipelines/`
- Added `services-http` (from Phase 51) + 4 new names to `ALL_PIPELINES` in `run.sh`

## New Pipelines
| File | What It Exercises |
|------|-------------------|
| dag-dependencies.yml | 4-job DAG with `needs:` — parallel lifecycle |
| rules-conditional.yml | `rules: if:` — one job runs, one skipped |
| multi-image-jobs.yml | Two jobs with different images — pull dedup |
| allow-failure-exit-code.yml | `allow_failure: exit_codes: [42]` |
