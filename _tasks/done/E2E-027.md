# E2E-027: WASM variant routing in test scripts

**Status:** DONE
**Phase:** 19 — Meaningful E2E Tests

Replaced skip logic with variant routing:
- Added `get_test_variant()` to `lib.sh` (maps services→services-wasm, custom-image→custom-image-wasm for memory backend)
- Updated `github-runner/run.sh` to use variant routing instead of skipping
- Updated `gitlab-runner-docker/run.sh` to route variants into the pipeline list
- `should_skip_for_faas()` now always returns 1 (don't skip)
- Memory backend: 12 PASS, 0 SKIP (was 10 PASS, 2 SKIP)
