# P72-014 — Verify Central Tests with Memory Backend

**Status:** Complete
**Phase:** 72D (Central Multi-Backend E2E Tests)

## What Was Done

Ran full `tests/` module with memory backend. All 65 tests pass (61 existing + 4 new arithmetic).

Shell arithmetic tests (TestArithmeticExecution, TestArithmeticNonZeroExit, TestArithmeticExecInContainer) work on memory/WASM because they use shell built-in `$((...))` arithmetic.

TestArithmeticEvalBinary correctly skips on memory backend — WASM sandbox physically cannot execute native Go binaries. This is not an env var gate but a real platform limitation.

## Test Results

```
cd tests && go test -v -count=1 ./...
65 PASS
```
