# P26-001: Add stdin pipe to sandbox Process

**Status:** DONE
**Phase:** 26 — GitLab Real Execution + Upstream Multi-Backend Coverage

## Changes
- `sandbox/process.go`: Added `stdinReader *io.PipeReader` and `stdinWriter *io.PipeWriter` fields to `Process` struct. Created `io.Pipe()` in `NewProcess`, passed reader to `run()` (was `nil`). Added `StdinWriter() io.WriteCloser` method. Updated `Close()` to close stdin writer first.
- `sandbox/shell.go`: Added stdin-reading mode for bare `sh` invocations — when `sh` has no args and stdin is provided, reads all stdin via `io.ReadAll()` and executes through Go shell interpreter.
