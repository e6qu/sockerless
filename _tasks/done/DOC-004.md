# DOC-004: Re-run E2E tests with WASM sandbox

## Status: PENDING

## Description

Re-run the E2E test suites against the memory backend to verify the WASM sandbox works correctly with real CI runners (act + gitlab-runner). The memory backend now uses real WASM execution instead of synthetic echo, which may surface new issues in E2E workflows.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] `make e2e-github-memory` passes (12 workflows)
- [ ] `make e2e-gitlab-memory` passes (12 pipelines)
- [ ] Document any new issues or behavior differences
- [ ] Update E2E test expectations if needed (some tests may check for synthetic echo output)

## Dependencies

- DOC-001, DOC-002, DOC-003 (documentation updates should be done first)
