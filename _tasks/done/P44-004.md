# P44-004 — Reconstruct Container State From Registry on Startup
**Status:** Done
**Phase:** 44 — Crash-Only Software

Added ReconstructContainerState() to recovery.go. For each active registry entry without a Store container, creates a stub container (state="running") using metadata (image, name). Called from RecoverRegistry after RecoverOnStartup. 4 new tests: TestReconstructContainerState, TestReconstructSkipsExisting, TestReconstructSkipsCleanedUp, TestReconstructDefaultName.
