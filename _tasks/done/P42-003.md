# P42-003: Multi-Job Workflow Engine

**Status:** Complete
**Phase:** 42

Created `bleephub/workflows.go` with Workflow/WorkflowJob types, submitWorkflow (validates no cycles, dispatches root jobs), dispatchReadyJobs (dependency resolution, skip on failure), onJobCompleted (cascade to dependents), buildJobMessageFromDef (supports run: and uses: steps), buildNeedsContext. Hooked onJobCompleted into run_service.go. Added Workflows map and NextRunID to store. 10 unit tests pass.
