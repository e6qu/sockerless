# AB-001: Add agent bridge to core's default exec/attach handlers

**Component:** Core (Shared backend library)
**Phase:** 6
**Depends on:** CORE-002
**Estimated effort:** M
**Status:** DONE

---

## Description
Enhanced core's handleExecStart to check AgentAddress on the container. If set, dials the agent via agent.Dial() and calls BridgeExec(). If empty, falls back to synthetic exec. Same pattern for handleContainerAttach with BridgeAttach(). Added agent module dependency to core's go.mod.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. Core handleExecStart uses agent.Dial + BridgeExec when AgentAddress is set
2. Core handleContainerAttach uses agent.Dial + BridgeAttach when AgentAddress is set
3. Falls back to synthetic behavior when AgentAddress is empty
4. backends/core/go.mod includes agent dependency

## Definition of Done
- [x] `go build ./...` passes
- [x] `go vet ./...` passes
- [x] All 102 existing tests pass unchanged
