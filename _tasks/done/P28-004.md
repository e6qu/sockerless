# P28-004: Run upstream-test-act for all 7 backends

**Status:** DONE
**Phase:** 28

## Results

TestRunEvent Docker mode subtests:

| Backend | PASS | FAIL | Total | Mode |
|---------|:----:|:----:|:-----:|------|
| memory | 57 | 28 | 85 | individual |
| ecs | 56 | 31 | 87 | monolithic |
| lambda | 57 | 30 | 87 | monolithic |
| cloudrun | 54 | 33 | 87 | monolithic |
| gcf | 58 | 29 | 87 | monolithic |
| aca | 58 | 29 | 87 | monolithic |
| azf | 69 | 16 | 85 | individual |

Key findings:
- AZF requires individual mode (hangs in monolithic on first test)
- AZF has highest pass count (69) due to individual mode isolation + real bash
- CloudRun has slightly more failures than other cloud backends
- All backends share core failure set: node.js (16), build (2), network (2), pwsh/python (2)
