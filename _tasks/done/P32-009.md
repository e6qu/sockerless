# P32-009: Split frontends/docker/containers.go

**Phase:** 32B (Code Splitting)
**Depends on:** —
**Estimated effort:** S

---

## Description

Split `frontends/docker/containers.go` (419 lines) by responsibility. This file is the frontend proxy layer that translates Docker REST API calls into backend internal API calls.

## What to Do

1. Read `frontends/docker/containers.go` to identify natural split points
2. Split into 2-3 files organized by:
   - **Lifecycle** (create, start, stop, kill, remove, restart, wait, pause, unpause)
   - **Query/Streaming** (inspect, list, logs, attach, top, stats, rename)
   - **Archive** (put/head/get archive) — may be small enough to keep inline

Target: each file under 250 lines.

## Acceptance Criteria

1. No file over 300 lines in `frontends/docker/`
2. All tests pass: `make test`, `make lint`
3. No behavior changes

## After Completing

Update `_tasks/done/P32-009.md`. Update `STATUS.md` progress line.
