# P32-008: Split sandbox/builtins.go into focused files

**Phase:** 32B (Code Splitting)
**Depends on:** —
**Estimated effort:** S

---

## Description

Split `sandbox/builtins.go` (597 lines) into focused files by category. The file is structurally clean (21 independent functions) but too large for a single context window. Keep the dispatch maps in a small central file.

## File Split Plan

### `builtins.go` — Dispatch Maps Only (~60 lines)

Keep:
- `builtinCommands` map — maps command names to handler functions
- `fileArgCommands` map — maps command names needing path rewriting to their arg indices
- Import of other builtin files is automatic (same package)

### `builtins_fs.go` — Filesystem Builtins (~300 lines)

Move functions that operate on files:
- `builtinTouch` — create/update file timestamps
- `builtinTee` — copy stdin to file and stdout
- `builtinLn` — create symlinks
- `builtinStat` — file stat info
- `builtinSha256sum` — SHA-256 hash
- `builtinMd5sum` — MD5 hash
- `builtinReadlink` — resolve symlinks
- `builtinMktemp` — create temp files/dirs

### `builtins_text.go` — Text Processing Builtins (~130 lines)

Move functions that transform text/data:
- `builtinBase64` — base64 encode/decode
- `builtinBasename` — extract filename
- `builtinDirname` — extract directory
- `builtinSeq` — generate number sequences
- `builtinEnv` — print environment

### `builtins_system.go` — System Info Builtins (~100 lines)

Move functions that report system state:
- `builtinUname` — system name
- `builtinHostname` — hostname
- `builtinId` — user identity
- `builtinDate` — date/time
- `builtinPwd` — working directory
- `builtinWhich` — command lookup

## Acceptance Criteria

1. `builtins.go` ≤ 80 lines (maps + imports only)
2. `builtins_fs.go`, `builtins_text.go`, `builtins_system.go` each under 300 lines
3. All tests pass: `cd sandbox && go test -v ./...` (46 tests), `make lint`
4. No behavior changes

## After Completing

Update `_tasks/done/P32-008.md`. Update `STATUS.md` progress line.
