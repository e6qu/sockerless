# P49-003: Server Start/Stop/Restart

**Status:** Done
**Phase:** 49 — Server Lifecycle + Metrics

Created `cmd/sockerless/server.go` with `sockerless server start/stop/restart`. Start resolves backend binary (`sockerless-backend-{type}` from PATH), launches backend+frontend as child processes, writes PIDs to `~/.sockerless/run/{context}/`. Stop reads PIDs, sends SIGTERM, removes PID files. Restart = stop + start.
