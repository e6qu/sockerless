# P44-001 — Registry Persistence + Auto-Save + Atomic Write
**Status:** Done
**Phase:** 44 — Crash-Only Software

Added auto-save to ResourceRegistry (calls Save() after Register and MarkCleanedUp). Made Save() atomic (write to .tmp then rename). Added logger field. Wired registry path from SOCKERLESS_REGISTRY_PATH / SOCKERLESS_DATA_DIR env vars in NewBaseServer. 3 new tests: TestRegistryAutoSave, TestRegistryAtomicWrite, TestRegistryAutoSaveOnCleanup.
