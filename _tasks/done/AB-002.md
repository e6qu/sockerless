# AB-002: Remove ExecStart overrides from container-based backends

**Component:** ECS/CloudRun/ACA
**Phase:** 6
**Depends on:** AB-001
**Estimated effort:** S
**Status:** DONE

---

## Description
Removed ExecStart override from ECS, CloudRun, ACA server.go RouteOverrides. Deleted backends/{ecs,cloudrun,aca}/exec.go (3 files with duplicated synthetic exec logic). These backends now use core's enhanced handler which auto-dials the agent.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. No ExecStart in RouteOverrides for ECS/CloudRun/ACA
2. exec.go deleted from all 3 backends
3. All backends build

## Definition of Done
- [x] `go build ./...` passes
- [x] `go vet ./...` passes
- [x] All 102 existing tests pass unchanged
