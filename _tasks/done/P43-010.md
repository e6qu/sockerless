# P43-010: Integration Tests

**Status:** Done
**Phase:** 43 — Cloud Resource Tracking

## What
Validated that tag additions don't break container lifecycle:
- `TestResourceTaggingIntegration` in `tests/monitoring_resource_tracking_test.go`
- Creates container with labels, starts, waits, inspects — verifies labels preserved
- All sim-test-all tests pass (129 PASS, 0 FAIL) — tags don't break any backend

## Files
- `tests/monitoring_resource_tracking_test.go` (NEW)
