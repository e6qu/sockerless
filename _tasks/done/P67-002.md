# P67-002: Refactor Network Handlers to Use Driver

**Status:** Done
**Phase:** 67 — Network Isolation (Linux)

Refactored all 7 network handlers in `handle_networks.go` to be thin HTTP→driver adapters. Updated `buildEndpointForNetwork` to use IPAllocator. Container remove now uses `Drivers.Network.Disconnect()`.
