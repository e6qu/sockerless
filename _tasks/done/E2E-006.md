# E2E-006: GitLab runner orchestrate.sh + run.sh

**Status:** DONE
**Phase:** 13 — E2E Runner Tests
**Effort:** M

## What Was Built

- `tests/e2e-live-tests/gitlab-runner-docker/orchestrate.sh` — Enhanced orchestrator supporting PIPELINE env var for selecting which pipeline YAML to push. Same flow as smoke-tests/gitlab/orchestrate.sh: wait for GitLab, get token, create project, push pipeline, register runner, start runner, monitor. Writes JSON result to /results/result.json. Shows failed job logs.
- `tests/e2e-live-tests/gitlab-runner-docker/run.sh` — Entry script with --backend/--pipeline/--mode flags. Builds Docker images, iterates pipelines, runs docker compose up for each, skips FaaS-incompatible tests, captures logs, writes summary.
