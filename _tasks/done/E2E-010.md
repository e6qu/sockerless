# E2E-010: Run GitLab E2E with All Cloud Backends

**Status:** DONE
**Phase:** 14 — GitLab E2E Cloud Backends + CI
**Effort:** L

## What Was Done

Ran all 12 GitLab CI pipelines against all 7 backends (memory + 6 cloud via simulators):

| Backend | PASS | FAIL | Total |
|---------|:----:|:----:|:-----:|
| Memory | 12 | 0 | 12 |
| ECS | 12 | 0 | 12 |
| Lambda | 12 | 0 | 12 |
| CloudRun | 12 | 0 | 12 |
| GCF | 12 | 0 | 12 |
| ACA | 12 | 0 | 12 |
| AZF | 12 | 0 | 12 |

## Fix Applied

- `timeout.yml`: Increased pipeline timeout from 30s to 2m to account for cloud backend overhead (container creation via simulator API, agent health check waits)
