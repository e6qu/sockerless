# P26-008: Run Docker verification, document results

**Status:** DONE
**Phase:** 26

## Results

### Verified (Docker)
- `make sim-test-all` — 107 PASS, 0 FAIL
- `cd sandbox && go test -v ./...` — 30 PASS (29 existing + 1 new PATH test)
- `make lint` — all 13 modules clean
- `make e2e-github-memory` — 22 PASS, 0 FAIL (17 existing + 5 new workflows)
- Upstream GCL (all 7 backends) — 25 PASS, 0 FAIL per backend (175 total)

### GitLab E2E Memory
Discovered that removing `SOCKERLESS_SYNTHETIC=1` was premature — gitlab-runner requires helper binaries (`gitlab-runner-helper`, `gitlab-runner-build`) that cannot run in WASM. Restored `SOCKERLESS_SYNTHETIC=1` for GitLab memory backend. The stdin forwarding and attach-before-start fixes from Phase 26 are still valuable for cloud backends.

### Upstream Act
Tests timing out with 60min timeout. The go test framework panics on timeout without printing individual subtest results. Need longer timeout or test filtering.
