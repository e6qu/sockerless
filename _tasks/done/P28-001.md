# P28-001: Individual subtest runner for upstream act

**Status:** DONE
**Phase:** 28

## Changes
- Added `--individual` flag to `tests/upstream/act/run.sh` for per-subtest isolation
- Individual mode: discovers subtests from testdata dirs, runs each in its own `go test` with 3-minute timeout
- Auto-detection: memory and azf use individual mode (hang in monolithic), cloud backends use monolithic
- Also runs top-level tests: TestRunEventHostEnvironment, TestRunEventSecrets, TestRunEventPullRequest
- Added `upstream-test-act-individual` Makefile target
- Memory individual results: 57 PASS / 28 FAIL (vs 56/31 monolithic — +1 PASS, no hangs)
- AZF individual results: 69 PASS / 16 FAIL (monolithic hangs on first test)
