# P48-004: CLI Status + PS Commands

**Status:** Done
**Phase:** 48 — Private API Skeleton + Health + Status

Created `cmd/sockerless/client.go` with shared HTTP helpers (`mgmtGet`, `mgmtPost`, `activeAddrs`). Created `cmd/sockerless/status.go` — queries healthz+status from both frontend and backend. Created `cmd/sockerless/ps.go` — container summary table from backend. Added both to main dispatch.
