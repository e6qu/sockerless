# P52-004 — Other CI Consumers (Brief Notes)

**Status:** Done
**Date:** 2026-02-23

## Notes
Added brief "Other Docker API Consumers" section to WHAT_WE_DID.md noting:
- Drone CI, Buildkite, Woodpecker use similar Docker API patterns
- TestContainers is the most interesting future target
- Full investigation deferred to production phases (53+)
