# P42-005: Artifact + Cache API Stubs

**Status:** Complete
**Phase:** 42

Created `bleephub/artifacts.go` with Twirp-style artifact service (CreateArtifact, upload, FinalizeArtifact, ListArtifacts, GetSignedArtifactURL, download) and cache stubs (reserve=204, lookup=204 miss, upload=200 discard, finalize=200 discard). ArtifactStore holds in-memory artifacts. 6 unit tests pass.
