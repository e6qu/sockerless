# P46-002 — ECS multi-container task definition + deferred start

**Status:** Done
**Date:** 2026-02-22

## What
Extracted `buildContainerDef()` from `registerTaskDefinition()`, added `containerInput` struct, refactored to accept `[]containerInput`. Added deferred start check in `handleContainerStart`, extracted `runECSTask()` helper, added `startMultiContainerTask()` for multi-container pod materialization.
