# SIM-027: Spawn agent subprocess in Azure simulator (ACA job start)

**Status:** DONE
**Effort:** M

## What Changed

When an ACA job execution starts and the job env contains
`SOCKERLESS_AGENT_CALLBACK_URL`, the Azure simulator spawns the agent subprocess.
Agent-managed executions skip auto-stop. Agents are cleaned up on stop execution
and delete job.

## Files Modified

- `simulators/azure/containerapps.go` — Added `acaAgentProcs sync.Map`, agent spawn
  in job start handler, cleanup in stop/delete handlers, helper functions
  `acaGetAgentCallbackURL`, `acaStartAgentProcess`, `acaStopAgentProcess`
