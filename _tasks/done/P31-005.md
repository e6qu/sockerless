# P31-005: Run upstream act tests, update results

**Phase:** 31
**Status:** Pending (requires Docker build)
**Date:** 2026-02-21

## Notes

Upstream act tests require building a Docker image with the latest sandbox binaries.
Expected improvement: `defaults-run` and `workdir` should now pass (57→59+).
New builtins may also help additional tests.

This task should be run when Docker is available.
