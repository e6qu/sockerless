# P71-018: CLI Arithmetic Tests

## What
Added 6 CLI tests (2 per cloud) that create container service jobs with the eval-arithmetic binary, execute them via cloud CLIs, and verify results and logs.

## Files Created
- `simulators/aws/cli-tests/arithmetic_test.go` — 2 tests (ECS eval + invalid)
- `simulators/gcp/cli-tests/arithmetic_test.go` — 2 tests (Cloud Run eval + invalid)
- `simulators/azure/cli-tests/arithmetic_test.go` — 2 tests (Container Apps eval + invalid)

## Files Modified
- `simulators/{aws,gcp,azure}/cli-tests/helpers_test.go` — added `evalBinaryPath` var + build step in TestMain

## Test Results
- AWS CLI: 26 PASS (was 24, +2 arithmetic)
- GCP CLI: 21 PASS (was 19, +2 arithmetic) — gcloud/az CLIs skip gracefully on macOS
- Azure CLI: 19 PASS (was 17, +2 arithmetic) — gcloud/az CLIs skip gracefully on macOS
