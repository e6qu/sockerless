# P72-002: CloudRun Arithmetic Integration Tests

**Phase**: 72 (Full-Stack E2E Tests)
**Status**: ✅ Complete

## What
Added 6 arithmetic evaluator integration tests to `backends/cloudrun/`. Fixed two critical issues:

1. **Fast-exit fix**: `waitForExecutionRunning` now returns `(agentAddr, completedExitCode, error)` instead of `(string, error)`. When execution completes before agent is reachable, container is stopped with real exit code.
2. **gRPC logging fix**: `logadmin` client uses gRPC but was connecting to HTTP port. Added `grpcAddrFromEndpoint()` to derive gRPC port (HTTP port + 1).

## Files
- `backends/cloudrun/arithmetic_integration_test.go` — new (6 tests)
- `backends/cloudrun/integration_test.go` — modified (eval binary build in TestMain)
- `backends/cloudrun/containers.go` — modified (fast-exit path)
- `backends/cloudrun/gcp.go` — modified (gRPC logadmin endpoint)
