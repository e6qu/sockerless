# P63-001: Fix Health Check Race Condition

**Status:** Done
**Phase:** 63

## Summary
Fixed pre-existing race condition in health check monitoring where HealthState was shared between update goroutine and Get callers without synchronization.

## Changes
- `backends/core/handle_extended.go`: Deep-copy HealthState in `runHealthCheckLoop` before writing to `c.State.Health` to prevent pointer sharing race
- `backends/core/handle_extended.go`: Ensure synchronized access to health state across concurrent reads and writes
