# P27-005: Fix upstream test failures where practical

**Status:** DONE
**Phase:** 27

## Changes
- Added `findInPATH()` function to `sandbox/shell.go` for PATH-based script resolution
- Modified `wasmExecHandler` to check PATH for script files before falling back to busybox applets
- Added `TestPATHScriptOverride` to `sandbox/sandbox_test.go`
- Sandbox unit tests: 30 PASS (was 29)
- `make sim-test-all`: 107 PASS, 0 FAIL (no regressions)
- This fixes upstream act tests `env-and-path` and `environment-files` where PATH scripts should override busybox builtins
