# E2E-024: Wire callback URL into FaaS backends

**Status:** DONE
**Phase:** 19 — Meaningful E2E Tests

All 3 FaaS backends (Lambda, GCF, AZF) now pass `SOCKERLESS_AGENT_CALLBACK_URL`
as a function environment variable containing the full callback URL with id and token.
This allows the simulators to start agent subprocesses without any backend-specific logic.

Also increased simulator-mode agent timeout from 2s to 5s to allow agent startup time.
