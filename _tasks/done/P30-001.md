# P30-001: Define driver interfaces

**Component:** Core (backends/core)
**Phase:** 30
**Status:** DONE

---

Created `backends/core/drivers.go` with 4 driver interfaces (ExecDriver, FilesystemDriver, StreamDriver, ProcessLifecycleDriver) and DriverSet struct. Each interface formalizes a dispatch pattern that was previously an if/else chain in handler code.
