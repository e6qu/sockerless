# P44-006 — Remove bleephub Graceful Shutdown
**Status:** Done
**Phase:** 44 — Crash-Only Software

Removed the signal handler goroutine from bleephub/server.go that caught SIGTERM/SIGINT and called srv.Close(). Removed unused imports (os/signal, syscall). Go's default signal handling now terminates the process immediately. 190 unit tests still pass.
