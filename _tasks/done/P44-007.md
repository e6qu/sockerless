# P44-007 — Registry Load in BaseServer.ListenAndServe
**Status:** Done
**Phase:** 44 — Crash-Only Software

Added Registry.Load() call at the start of ListenAndServe. Logs warning on failure, logs active resource count on success. Safe for backends that already called RecoverRegistry (harmless second load). Ensures non-cloud backends (memory, docker) also load persisted registry.
