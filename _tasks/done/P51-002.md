# P51-002: Include jobServiceContainers in Job Message

**Status:** Done
**Phase:** 51 — CI Service Container Integration

Added `buildServiceContainers()` that converts `map[string]*ServiceDef` to the runner's expected format (map of alias → container spec with image, environment, ports, volumes, options). Wired into `buildJobMessageFromDef()` replacing the hardcoded `nil`. 2 new unit tests: with services (verifies populated map), without services (verifies nil).
