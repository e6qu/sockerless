# P71-019: Cross-Cloud Verification + State Save

## What
Verified all full test suites still pass with arithmetic tests included. Updated PLAN.md, STATUS.md, WHAT_WE_DID.md, MEMORY.md, and task logs.

## Test Results
- All 3 full SDK suites pass (42 + 43 + 38 = 123 SDK tests)
- AWS full CLI suite passes (26 tests)
- GCP/Azure CLI suites skip gracefully when CLIs not installed
- Total new tests: 27 (21 SDK + 6 CLI)
