# P23-004: Fix actionable API gaps from act results

**Status:** DONE

Five fixes applied:
1. resolveBindMounts processes HostConfig.Mounts (not just Binds)
2. Exec workdir inherits container Config.WorkingDir when empty
3. Smart relative path resolution in WASM shell (fileArgCommands whitelist)
4. Fixed bash -o pipefail flag parsing in RunSimpleCommand
5. Added TestBashOPipefail unit test

Result: 53 PASS / 34 FAIL (up from 45/42 baseline, +8 tests).
