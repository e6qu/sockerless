# SIM-024: Add reverse agent to ACA backend

**Status:** DONE
**Effort:** M

## What Changed

Added reverse agent support to the ACA backend. Same pattern as ECS/CloudRun:
- `jobspec.go`: Callback entrypoint + env vars in ACA job spec
- `containers.go`: IsTailDevNull early return, Prepare/WaitForAgent/WaitForDisconnect,
  AgentRegistry.Remove in kill/remove handlers
- Added `waitForExecutionComplete` helper (polls execution list for terminal states)

## Files Modified

- `backends/aca/jobspec.go` — Callback mode for job spec
- `backends/aca/containers.go` — Reverse agent flow + execution completion helper
