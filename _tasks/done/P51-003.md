# P51-003: Service Container Health Wait in Pod Start

**Status:** Done
**Phase:** 51 — CI Service Container Integration

Added `WaitForServiceHealth(podID, timeout)` to `BaseServer` in `pod_materialize.go`. Polls containers with `Healthcheck` configs until all become "healthy" or timeout. Skips containers without health checks and those with `NONE`. Uses 500ms polling interval. 3 new unit tests: all-healthy (immediate return), timeout (1s timeout with "starting" status), no-healthcheck (skipped, immediate return).
