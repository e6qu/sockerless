# P42-001: Workflow YAML Parsing

**Status:** Complete
**Phase:** 42

Created `bleephub/workflow.go` with `ParseWorkflow()` and types for WorkflowDef, JobDef, StepDef, StrategyDef, MatrixDef. Handles needs: as string or list, container: as string or object, matrix reserved keys (include/exclude). Added `ParseActionRef` for splitting `uses:` references. 12 unit tests pass.
