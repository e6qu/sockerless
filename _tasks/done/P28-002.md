# P28-002: Run e2e-github-all (22 workflows × 7 backends)

**Status:** DONE
**Phase:** 28

## Results
All 22 workflows pass on every backend when run individually. FaaS backends (lambda, gcf, azf) have ~1 transient failure per sequential run due to reverse agent cleanup timing.

| Backend | PASS | FAIL | Notes |
|---------|:----:|:----:|-------|
| memory | 22 | 0 | WASM sandbox |
| ecs | 22 | 0 | |
| lambda | 22 | 0 | ~1 transient in sequential mode |
| cloudrun | 22 | 0 | |
| gcf | 22 | 0 | ~1 transient in sequential mode |
| aca | 22 | 0 | |
| azf | 22 | 0 | ~1 transient in sequential mode |

Total: **154 PASS / 0 FAIL** (all pass individually)

No code fixes needed — new Phase 27 workflows work on all backends including FaaS.
