# P62-004 — Restart Policy Delay + MaxRetry
Status: DONE
Phase: 62 — Docker API Hardening

Added RestartDelay(restartCount) with exponential backoff: 100ms * 2^count, capped at 60s. Applied in handleRestartPolicy before respawn.
Files: restart_policy.go (modified, +15 lines), restart_delay_test.go (7 tests)
