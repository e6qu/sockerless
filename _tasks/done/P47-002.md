# P47-002: Core Context Loader

**Status:** Done

Created `backends/core/context.go` with `LoadContextEnv(logger)` that reads active context env map and sets vars not already in the environment. Path helpers duplicate CLI conventions (~15 lines) to keep CLI dependency-free. Warns on missing/invalid config without crashing.

Created `backends/core/context_test.go` with 6 tests: no-context no-op, sets vars, does not override existing, missing file, invalid JSON, active file read. All pass.
