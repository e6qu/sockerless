# P70-024: CI Integration for Simulator Tests

**Phase:** 70
**Status:** DONE
**PR:** https://github.com/e6qu/sockerless/pull/37

---

## What was done

Added simulator tests to PR-level CI (`ci.yml`):

1. **`sim-shared` matrix entry** in `unit-tests` job — runs 15 ProcessRunner unit tests (5 per cloud) with `GOWORK=off`
2. **`simulator-sdk-tests` job** — 3-way matrix (aws/gcp/azure), runs `make sdk-test` with `GOWORK=off`, builds simulator binary and runs all SDK integration tests including real process execution
3. **`shared-test` target** in each simulator Makefile (aws/gcp/azure), included in `make test` so `docker-test` also covers it

## Files modified

- `.github/workflows/ci.yml` — new matrix entry + new job
- `simulators/aws/Makefile` — `shared-test` target
- `simulators/gcp/Makefile` — `shared-test` target
- `simulators/azure/Makefile` — `shared-test` target
