# P30-003: WASM/process driver implementations

**Component:** Core (backends/core)
**Phase:** 30
**Status:** DONE

---

Created `backends/core/drivers_process.go` (named to avoid GOARCH=wasm build constraint) with WASMExecDriver, WASMFilesystemDriver, WASMStreamDriver, and WASMProcessLifecycleDriver. Each wraps ContainerProcess operations and falls back to next driver in chain.

**Learning:** Go interprets `_wasm.go` suffix as GOARCH=wasm build constraint. File must not end in `_wasm.go` to compile for all architectures.
