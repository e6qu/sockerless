# E2E-023: Simulator agent subprocess execution

**Status:** DONE
**Phase:** 19 — Meaningful E2E Tests

Added agent subprocess spawning to all 3 FaaS simulators' invoke handlers.
When a function has `SOCKERLESS_AGENT_CALLBACK_URL` in its environment variables,
the simulator starts `sockerless-agent --callback <url> --keep-alive -- tail -f /dev/null`
as a subprocess. Subprocesses are tracked and killed on function delete.

This replaces the originally planned LocalAgentManager in backends/core — the simulator
now does the work, keeping backend code identical between live and simulator modes.
