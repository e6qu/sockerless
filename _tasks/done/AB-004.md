# AB-004: Remove ExecStart overrides from FaaS backends

**Component:** Lambda/GCF/AZF
**Phase:** 6
**Depends on:** AB-001
**Estimated effort:** S
**Status:** DONE

---

## Description
Removed ExecStart override from Lambda, GCF, AZF server.go. Deleted backends/{lambda,cloudrun-functions,azure-functions}/exec.go (3 files). FaaS backends now use core's default handler which falls through to synthetic exec (since AgentAddress is empty).

## Acceptance Criteria
1. No ExecStart in RouteOverrides for Lambda/GCF/AZF
2. exec.go deleted from all 3 backends

## Definition of Done
- [x] `go build ./...` passes
- [x] `go vet ./...` passes
- [x] All 102 existing tests pass unchanged
