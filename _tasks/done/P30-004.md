# P30-004: Agent driver implementations

**Component:** Core (backends/core)
**Phase:** 30
**Status:** DONE

---

Created `backends/core/drivers_agent.go` with AgentExecDriver, AgentFilesystemDriver, and AgentStreamDriver. Each checks container's AgentAddress field and dispatches to reverse agent (persistent connection) or forward agent (dial), falling back to next driver in chain.
