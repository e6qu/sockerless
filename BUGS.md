## Open Bugs

None — all known bugs have been fixed.

## False Positives

Bugs investigated and confirmed as non-issues. Tracked here to avoid re-collecting.

| ID | File | Reported Issue | Why False Positive |
|----|------|----------------|-------------------|
| FP-001 | `api/types.go:554-558` | Event Type/Action/Actor use uppercase JSON tags | Docker API uses PascalCase for these fields — current tags are correct |
| FP-002 | `api/types.go` | EndpointSettings missing IPAMConfig type (OB-057) | EndpointIPAMConfig already exists since Sprint 20 — the type was added in BUG-175 |
