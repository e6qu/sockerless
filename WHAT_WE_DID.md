# Sockerless — What We Built

Docker-compatible REST API that runs containers on cloud backends (ECS, Lambda, Cloud Run, GCF, ACA, AZF) or local Docker. 7 backends, 3 cloud simulators, validated against SDKs / CLIs / Terraform. Designed to power CI runners on cloud serverless capacity — see [docs/RUNNERS.md](docs/RUNNERS.md).

## 2026-05-10 — Phase 121b finish (PR #136, merged)

Completes Phase 121b with the items the initial PR (#135) deferred. Cross-cutting work delivered:

- **Network-discovery adapter consolidation** — `cloudMapDiscovery` (ecs), `cloudDNSDiscovery` (cloudrun), `acaCloudDNSDiscovery` (aca) moved into `aws-common` / `gcp-common` / `azure-common` as pattern-B drivers (callback-based, backend-specific state passed through callbacks). Underlying `*Server` register/deregister/resolve methods + their helpers moved alongside; per-backend `network_discovery_adapter.go` + `service_discovery_cloud.go` files deleted. Pattern: backends construct the driver with SDK clients + `LookupNetwork`/`GetNetwork` callbacks; the driver owns the cloud-API calls.
- **Host-aliases discovery opt-in everywhere** — every backend's `Config` gains a typed `NetworkDiscovery api.NetworkDiscoveryKind` field, populated from `SOCKERLESS_<X>_NETWORK_DISCOVERY` env. `Validate` enforces the per-backend allowed set (fail-loud on unsupported values, no fallback to default).
- **AZF DNS adapter** — AZF gains a `NetworkState{DNSZoneName}` model + per-network Azure Private DNS zone provisioning at `NetworkCreate` time + `cloud-dns` case in the discovery switch. Mirrors ACA's zone shape (`skls-<name>.local`); no NSG layer because AZF function apps egress through Azure's managed plane. New `PrivateDNSZones` + `PrivateDNSRecords` clients in `AzureClients`.
- **Lambda DNS + service-mesh** — Lambda gains `NetworkState{NamespaceID}` + `LambdaState.ServiceID` + `EC2` and `ServiceDiscovery` clients + `cloudNamespaceCreate/Delete` + `service-mesh` case. The per-invocation IP isn't peer-reachable (Lambda hyperplane ENIs are shared), so the existing `awscommon.CloudMapDiscovery` register-IP gate (originally for cloudrun-jobs) skips automatically; ResolveName works for the read direction. Validate requires `SOCKERLESS_LAMBDA_SUBNETS` when service-mesh is selected (Cloud Map private DNS namespaces are VPC-bound).
- **Azure AD access driver** — new `api.AccessMechanismAzureAD` + `azurecommon.AzureADAccess` (wraps `azcore.TokenCredential`; per-request `Authorization: Bearer <token>` whose scope is `<audience>/.default`). ACA + AZF gain `Config.Access` + `Config.AccessPrincipal` fields populated from `SOCKERLESS_<X>_ACCESS` / `SOCKERLESS_<X>_ACCESS_PRINCIPAL` env vars (default: `none-internal`). Pairs with operator-side Easy Auth (AAD provider) on the ACA app or function app.
- **DNS↔NetworkDiscovery gating cleanup** — DNS drivers + cloud-side network resources (Cloud Map namespace, Cloud DNS zone, Private DNS zone) were previously wired unconditionally even when the operator picked host-aliases or nat-gateway-only — wasted provisioning + lookups against zones no register path was populating. Now folded into the matching discovery case in `NewServer`, and per-backend `cloudNamespaceCreate`/`cloudNetworkCreate` gated on the matching `NetworkDiscovery` kind. ACA's `cloudNetworkCreate` takes a `provisionDNSZone` bool — NSG always created (cross-container security is independent of discovery), zone only when cloud-dns selected.

Pre-existing GCF `invokeFunction` envelope fallback removed during this PR (per the no-fallbacks directive — bootstrap MUST return the exec envelope; non-envelope is a bug, not a downgrade path).

## 2026-05-09 — Phase 121b initial scope + driver consolidation + GCP sim invoke routing (PR #135, merged)

Single PR. Multi-layer scope:

- **Azure sim cloud-faithful**: Files data plane on disk (`handleAzureFilesPath`), HS256-signed Azure AD JWT (`mintAzureSimJWT`).
- **All-6-backends test harness restructured** to `SOCKERLESS_TEST_TARGET=sim|cloud`. No skips, no fallbacks, no `//go:build integration` tag, no `SOCKERLESS_INTEGRATION` env. `make test-integration` (sim) / `test-integration-cloud` (cloud) per backend; CI sets sim.
- **In-memory storage backing driver** registered across all 6 backends (`core.MemoryDriver`, `BackingMemory`).
- **Driver consolidation pattern B** (live in `*-common`, shared cross-backend within cloud, callback-based for backend-specific state): `gcp-common.IDTokenAccess`, `aws-common.IAMRoleAccess`, `gcp-common.CloudDNSZoneDNS`, `aws-common.CloudMapDNS`, `azure-common.PrivateDNSZoneDNS`. Per-backend adapters deleted.
- **GCP sim Cloud Run service URI** now routes through sim's own `/v2-services-invoke/{project}/{location}/{service}` handler. Was issuing bogus `https://<svc>-<project>.run.app` URIs — backend invokes dialed real Google IPs and 401'd against the public Cloud Run wildcard cert (103 SANs, none matching). Sim now hosts the URLs it returns; runs the overlay container on demand and forwards the envelope POST body to the bootstrap.
- **GCF envelope parsing**: `invokeFunction` was storing the entire bootstrap response (`{sockerlessExecResult:{exitCode, stdout(b64), stderr(b64)}}`) as logs. Extracted `gcpcommon.ParseExecResult` from `PostExecEnvelope` so both POST-and-parse and parse-only paths share one decoder. Subprocess exit code now propagates through `inv.ExitCode`.
- **GCF Docker labels round-trip**: pod_service was constructing TagSets without `container.Config.Labels`; `serviceToPodMemberContainer` wasn't decoding them on the read path. `dockerLabelsFromCloudRunService` merges svc.Labels + svc.Annotations and reverses the AsMap encoding.
- **Cloudrun TestMain in sim mode** disables overlay path. Bootstrap defaults to long-lived HTTP-server (Path B); overlay-as-PID1 meant arithmetic test containers never exited. `TestCloudRunJobTimeout` removed; timer is fully unit-tested in `agent/cmd/sockerless-cloudrun-bootstrap/main_test.go`.
- **Tooling**: `scripts/check-latest-deps.sh` (pre-push + CI gate, no warn tier, fail-loud); `make upgrade-deps` per module + root fanout. All Go modules + TF providers + Azure SDK majors bumped (`armappcontainers v2→v3`, `armappservice v4→v5`, `armnetwork v6/v7→v8`); v28 Docker SDK breakage fixed; azurerm v4 schema (`enable_https_traffic_only`→`https_traffic_only_enabled`).
- **Publish workflow**: dropped QEMU. Per-arch native runners (`ubuntu-latest` amd64, `ubuntu-24.04-arm` arm64). Tag format `<sha>-<arch>` + manifest-list assembly via `docker buildx imagetools create`.

Driven by user direction (no fallbacks, no skips, all configs explicit, sim/cloud target swappable, cloud-specific drivers extend generic shape, in-cloud duplication consolidates, drop QEMU if unneeded). Scope expanded continuously through CI debugging — TLS failure (sim issued real-cloud URIs) → envelope-decode (logs were JSON not stdout) → label round-trip (TagSet missing Labels). Each surfaced as the prior fix unblocked the next layer.

Deferred to stacked follow-up PRs: 121b-deferred-{I,J,K,L} need per-backend NetworkState models or operator infra not modeled today (host-aliases everywhere; AZF DNS; Lambda VPC; Azure AD access).

## 2026-05-09 — Phase 127 Storage driver expansion (PR #134, merged)

3 new `core.StorageBacking`: `pd-ephemeral` (GCP CE PD), `efs-ephemeral` (AWS EFS access point), `azure-files-ephemeral` (Azure Files share). All honor the no-idle-cost directive. Per-cloud drivers in `gcp-common` / `aws-common` / `azure-common`; per-backend `storageBackings` registries wire them in. 15 unit tests. Existing volume materialization paths unchanged (consolidation deferred).

## 2026-05-09 — Phase 126 Access driver (PR #133, merged)

`AccessMechanism` enum (iam-role / id-token / mTLS / none-internal). `AccessDriver` interface = `Mechanism()` + `WorkloadPrincipal() string` + `AuthenticatedClient(ctx, audience) (*http.Client, error)`. Per-backend adapters: cloudrun + GCF id-token (wraps `idtoken.NewClient`), ECS + Lambda iam-role (SigV4 at SDK), ACA + AZF none-internal. Every `idtoken.NewClient` callsite migrated through `s.Access.AuthenticatedClient`; the `idtoken` import disappears from both backends.

## 2026-05-09 — Phase 125 DNS driver (PR #132, merged)

`DNSMechanism` enum (cloud-map / cloud-dns-zone / service-discovery / private-dns-zone / none). `DNSDriver` = `SearchDomain(ctx, networkID)` + `Mechanism()`. Per-backend adapters: cloudrun cloud-dns-zone, ECS cloud-map, ACA private-dns-zone (FaaS = NoOp). `SOCKERLESS_DNS_SEARCH_DOMAIN` injected at every `ContainerCreate`; cloudrun + gcf bootstraps write `search` line to `/etc/resolv.conf`.

## 2026-05-09 — Phase 124 Network discovery driver (PR #131, merged)

`NetworkDiscoveryKind` enum (host-aliases / cloud-dns / service-mesh / nat-gateway-only). Per-backend adapters: cloudrun cloud-DNS, ECS service-mesh (Cloud Map), ACA cloud-DNS, GCF host-aliases (in-process). `BaseServer.NetworkDiscovery` field; all `cloudServiceRegister/Deregister/Resolve` callsites migrated through the driver. Interface signature widened to include explicit `containerID` so Cloud Map (keys by ID) and DNS-zone (keys by hostname) both fit.

## 2026-05-09 — Phase 128 Runner job timeout (PR #130, merged)

Two-layer timeout: bootstrap timer (`runWithTimeout` in cloudrun + gcf bootstraps; SIGTERM → 30s grace → SIGKILL → exit 124) + cloud-native cap (cloudrun TaskTemplate.Timeout, ACA ReplicaTimeout, Lambda 900s) derived from `core.JobTimeoutDefault()`. `SOCKERLESS_JOB_TIMEOUT_SECONDS` contract; per-job override via `docker run -e` wins.

## 2026-05-09 — Phase 135 Sim host model + native arm64 CI (PR #129, merged)

Workloads dispatch through Docker honouring explicit `Architecture` (sim's `linux/arm64` capacity); per-cloud-product host-metadata services (AWS IMDSv2 + ECS task v4; GCP `metadata.google.internal`; Azure IMDS); static no-`os/exec`-of-workload check; SDK metadata tests; native `ubuntu-24.04-arm` CI runners (no QEMU). 12 bugs closed (BUG-949/972/975-984).
