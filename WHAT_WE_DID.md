# Sockerless — What We Built

## The Idea

Sockerless presents an HTTP REST API identical to Docker's. CI runners (GitHub Actions via `act`, GitLab Runner, `gitlab-ci-local`) talk to it as if it were Docker, but instead of running containers locally, Sockerless farms work to cloud backends — ECS, Lambda, Cloud Run, Cloud Functions, Azure Container Apps, Azure Functions — or runs everything in-process via a WASM sandbox (the "memory" backend).

For development and testing, cloud simulators stand in for real AWS/GCP/Azure APIs, providing actual execution of tasks the same way a real cloud would. The simulators are validated against official cloud SDKs, CLIs, and Terraform providers.

    │                                           (wazero + mvdan.cc/sh
    ▼                                            + go-busybox)
Agent (inside container or reverse-connected)
```

**8 backends** share a common core (`backends/core/`) with driver interfaces:
- **ExecDriver** — runs commands (WASM shell, forward agent, reverse agent, or synthetic echo)
- **FilesystemDriver** — manages container filesystem (temp dirs, agent bridge, staging)
- **StreamDriver** — attach/logs streaming (pipes, WebSocket relay, log buffer)
- **ProcessLifecycleDriver** — start/stop/kill/cleanup

Each driver chains: Agent → Process → Synthetic, so every handler call falls through to the right implementation.

**3 simulators** (`simulators/{aws,gcp,azure}/`) implement enough cloud API surface for the backends to work. Each is tested against the real SDK, CLI, and Terraform provider for that cloud.

## Sprint 27 Summary (BUG-320 → BUG-336)

17 bugs fixed. The dominant pattern was `WaitChs.Delete` calls that deleted the channel from the map without closing it first, leaving any goroutine blocked on `<-ch` waiting forever. This affected `handleContainerRemove` and `handleContainerPrune` across all six cloud backends (ECS, CloudRun, ACA, Lambda, GCF, AZF) plus two core paths (`handleContainerRemove` and `store.RevertToCreated`) — 14 fixes in total. Two additional correctness bugs were fixed: ACA `handleContainerRestart` called `MarkCleanedUp` without an empty-check guard and deleted container state prematurely before the re-create sequence completed (BUG-334); and Docker `handleContainerCommit` constructed an image reference as `"repo:"` when the tag parameter was empty, producing an invalid ref that would be rejected by image stores (BUG-335). Finally, the frontend `handleContainerLogs` was not forwarding the `details` query parameter to the backend, silently dropping it for any client that set it (BUG-336).
