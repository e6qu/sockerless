# P70-011: GCP — Execution Status Field Completeness

**Component:** SIM (simulators/gcp)
**Phase:** 70 — Milestone 2 (GCP Fidelity)
**Depends on:** —
**Estimated effort:** S

---

## Description

Verify that `GetExecution` returns all count fields the Cloud Run backend
reads, with correct state transitions. The backend checks `RunningCount`,
`FailedCount`, `SucceededCount`, `CancelledCount`, and `CompletionTime`.

## Context

- Backend `backends/cloudrun/containers.go:594,664,691`: reads all count
  fields and CompletionTime to determine execution state
- Running: `RunningCount > 0`
- Failed: `FailedCount > 0`
- Cancelled: `CancelledCount > 0`
- Succeeded: `SucceededCount > 0`
- Completed: `CompletionTime != nil`

## Acceptance Criteria

1. GetExecution returns `RunningCount=1` while execution is active
2. GetExecution returns `SucceededCount=1, RunningCount=0, CompletionTime=<timestamp>`
   after successful completion
3. GetExecution returns `FailedCount=1, RunningCount=0, CompletionTime=<timestamp>`
   after failure
4. After CancelExecution: returns `CancelledCount=1, RunningCount=0, CompletionTime=<timestamp>`
5. SDK test covers all three terminal states (succeeded, failed, cancelled)

## Definition of Done

- [ ] `go build ./...` passes
- [ ] All existing tests pass
- [ ] New SDK test passes
- [ ] PR created via `gh pr create`, CI passes, merged via `gh pr merge`

## Suggested File Paths

- `simulators/gcp/cloudrunjobs.go` — verify/fix count field transitions
- `simulators/gcp/sdk-tests/run_test.go` — extend with status tests
