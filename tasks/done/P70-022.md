# P70-022: GCP Cloud Run Real Execution ✅

**Component:** SIM (simulators/gcp/)
**Phase:** 70 — Milestone 4 (Cross-Cloud)
**Depends on:** P70-020
**Completed:** 2026-02-28

## What Was Done

Wired ProcessRunner into Cloud Run Jobs auto-complete goroutine. Replaces `time.Sleep(timeout)` with real process execution when command is present. Process exit code determines succeeded vs failed count. Cancel handler kills running processes via `crjProcessHandles` sync.Map. Jobs with no command preserve sleep-then-succeed behavior.

## Files

- **Modified**: `simulators/gcp/cloudrunjobs.go` — added `crjProcessHandles`, `crjLogSink`, process execution in auto-complete goroutine, cancel in cancel handler
- **Modified**: `simulators/gcp/sdk-tests/run_test.go` — 3 new tests + `createAndRunJobWithCommand`

## Tests

11 Cloud Run SDK tests PASS (8 existing + 3 new):
- `TestCloudRun_ExecutionRunsCommand`
- `TestCloudRun_ExecutionFailedState`
- `TestCloudRun_ExecutionLogsRealOutput`
