# P70-023: Azure ACA Real Execution ✅

**Component:** SIM (simulators/azure/)
**Phase:** 70 — Milestone 4 (Cross-Cloud)
**Depends on:** P70-020
**Completed:** 2026-02-28

## What Was Done

Wired ProcessRunner into ACA Jobs auto-complete goroutine. Process exit code determines Succeeded vs Failed status. Stop handler kills running processes via `acaProcessHandles` sync.Map. Jobs with no command preserve sleep-then-succeed behavior.

## Files

- **Modified**: `simulators/azure/containerapps.go` — added `acaProcessHandles`, `acaLogSink`, process execution in auto-complete goroutine, cancel in stop handler
- **Modified**: `simulators/azure/sdk-tests/containerapps_test.go` — 3 new tests + `acaCreateJobWithCommand`

## Tests

10 ACA SDK tests PASS (7 existing + 3 new):
- `TestContainerApps_ExecutionRunsCommand`
- `TestContainerApps_ExecutionFailedStatus`
- `TestContainerApps_ExecutionLogsRealOutput`
