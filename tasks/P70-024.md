# P70-024: CI Integration for Simulator Smoke Tests

**Component:** CI (.github/workflows)
**Phase:** 70 — Milestone 4 (Cross-Cloud)
**Depends on:** P70-006, P70-012, P70-018, P70-023
**Estimated effort:** M

## Description

Add the P70-006/012/018 smoke tests to CI so they run on every push/PR.
Either extend `test-comprehensive.yml` or add them to the main `ci.yml`
test matrix.

## Context

- `ci.yml`: has `test-unit` matrix for 5 test suites
- `test-comprehensive.yml`: runs on merge + manual, includes sims, E2E, terraform
- The smoke tests are Go test files in `simulators/{cloud}/sdk-tests/`

## Acceptance Criteria

1. All three smoke tests (AWS, GCP, Azure) run in CI
2. Tests pass on both Linux (CI) and macOS (local dev)
3. Failure in any smoke test fails the CI job
4. Test results visible in CI output

## Definition of Done

- [ ] CI workflow updated
- [ ] All three smoke tests pass in CI
- [ ] PR created via `gh pr create`, CI passes, merged via `gh pr merge`

## Suggested File Paths

- `.github/workflows/ci.yml` or `.github/workflows/test-comprehensive.yml`

## Notes

- The smoke tests build the simulator binary and run it — they're self-contained
- They only need `golang:1.24` (no cloud CLI or Terraform)
- Consider adding to the existing `sim-test-all` matrix if one exists
