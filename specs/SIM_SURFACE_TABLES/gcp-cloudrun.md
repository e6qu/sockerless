# Sim surface — gcp-cloudrun

Surface registered in `simulators/gcp/cloudrun.go` (and related files grouped under this table). Rows below are the ops the sim currently registers — extracted by `scripts/seed-surface-tables.sh` from `mux.HandleFunc(...)` calls. ✗ rows for ops not handled by the sim are added when a community-filed issue or audit surfaces them.

## Status legend

- ✓ — implemented + tested
- ✗ — missing (paired with an open BUG or issue; never silent)
- 501 — stubbed NotImplemented (wire-visible gap)
- n/a — no meaningful client/provider surface for this op

## Coverage status

- Row-level SDK/Terraform cells summarize the maintained coverage matrix in `specs/SIM_TEST_COVERAGE_MATRIX.md`; detailed client files and client-family `n/a` decisions live there.
- Missing public-cloud operations that are not registered by the simulator still require a concrete BUG and a row here when discovered by a community issue or periodic audit.

## Discovery-revision mismatches

`GoogleCloudRunV2WorkerPoolScaling` is modelled with four members —
`scalingMode`, `minInstanceCount`, `maxInstanceCount` and
`manualInstanceCount` — while the pinned Cloud Run v2 Discovery document
(revision 20260603) and the published REST reference both declare only
`manualInstanceCount`. The three automatic-scaling members are real: the
official `hashicorp/google` provider's `google_cloud_run_v2_worker_pool`
resource exposes `scaling.scaling_mode` (`AUTOMATIC`/`MANUAL`),
`scaling.min_instance_count` and `scaling.max_instance_count`, and sends them
on the v2 wire under those camelCase names; `gcloud beta run worker-pools
deploy --min-instances/--max-instances` reaches the same members. Refreshing
the pin does not close the gap — Discovery revision 20260713, the newest
served by `run.googleapis.com/$discovery/rest?version=v2`, still publishes the
single member, and the `manual_instance_count` field number (6) in the
published `google.cloud.run.v2` protos shows the automatic-scaling members
occupy the unpublished 1–5 range. The simulator therefore models what the
official clients speak, and the runtime spec-validator's `unknown-field`
findings for these three members are allowlisted in
`simulators/gcp/spec-violation-allowlist.txt` until Google publishes them.

## Collapsed-port host disambiguation

Real Google Cloud serves `/v1/projects/{p}/locations/{l}/instances/…` from two
different hosts: Cloud Run Admin v1 (`run.googleapis.com`) exposes the
instances IAM triple there, and Memorystore for Redis
(`redis.googleapis.com`) exposes the Redis instance lifecycle. The
single-origin simulator resolves the owner in
`simulators/gcp/endpoint_hosts.go`: the request `Host` names the service when
the client resolves a real Google host, and otherwise the AIP-136 custom
method in the URI does — the IAM triple
(`getIamPolicy`/`setIamPolicy`/`testIamPermissions`) belongs to Cloud Run
alone and `export`/`failover`/`import`/`upgrade`/`rescheduleMaintenance` to
Memorystore alone.
