# Sim surface — aws-ecs

Surface registered in `simulators/aws/ecs_service.go` (and related files grouped under this table). Rows below are the ops the sim currently registers — extracted by `scripts/seed-surface-tables.sh` from `mux.HandleFunc(...)` calls. ✗ rows for ops not handled by the sim are added when a community-filed issue or audit surfaces them.

## Status legend

- ✓ — implemented + tested
- ✗ — missing (paired with an open BUG or issue; never silent)
- 501 — stubbed NotImplemented (wire-visible gap)
- n/a — no meaningful client/provider surface for this op

## Coverage status

- Row-level SDK/Terraform cells summarize the maintained coverage matrix in `specs/SIM_TEST_COVERAGE_MATRIX.md`; detailed client files and client-family `n/a` decisions live there.
- Missing public-cloud operations that are not registered by the simulator still require a concrete BUG and a row here when discovered by a community issue or periodic audit.
