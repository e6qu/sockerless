# Sim surface — aws-wafv2

Surface registered in `simulators/aws/wafv2.go` (and related files grouped under this table). Rows below are the ops the sim currently registers — extracted by `scripts/seed-surface-tables.sh` from `mux.HandleFunc(...)` calls. ✗ rows for ops not handled by the sim are added when a community-filed issue or audit surfaces them.

## Status legend

- ✓ — implemented + tested
- ✗ — missing (paired with an open BUG or issue; never silent)
- 501 — stubbed NotImplemented (wire-visible gap)
- n/a — no meaningful client/provider surface for this op

## Coverage status

- Row-level SDK/Terraform cells summarize the maintained coverage matrix in `specs/SIM_TEST_COVERAGE_MATRIX.md`; detailed client files and client-family `n/a` decisions live there.
- Missing public-cloud operations that are not registered by the simulator still require a concrete BUG and a row here when discovered by a community issue or periodic audit.

<!-- HAND-WRITTEN BEGIN -->
Amplify associations are data-plane active: the associated WebACL's default
action and IP-set rules inspect actual hosted requests, terminal BLOCK actions
return HTTP 403, and enabled WebACL/rule visibility configurations retain the
request method, URI, headers, client address, action, response code, and
timestamp. `GetSampledRequests` filters that observed traffic by WebACL,
metric, scope, and the requested (at most three-hour) time window, reports the
real population size, and applies `MaxItems`. Official AWS SDK tests prove
blocking, sampling, disassociation, and the restored hosted response.
