# Sim surface — gcp-iam

Surface registered in `simulators/gcp/iam.go` (and related files grouped under this table). Rows below are the ops the sim currently registers — extracted by `scripts/seed-surface-tables.sh` from `mux.HandleFunc(...)` calls. ✗ rows for ops not handled by the sim are added when a community-filed issue or audit surfaces them.

## Status legend

- ✓ — implemented + tested
- ✗ — missing (paired with an open BUG or issue; never silent)
- 501 — stubbed NotImplemented (wire-visible gap)
- n/a — no meaningful client/provider surface for this op

## Coverage status

- Row-level SDK/Terraform cells summarize the maintained coverage matrix in `specs/SIM_TEST_COVERAGE_MATRIX.md`; detailed client files and client-family `n/a` decisions live there.
- Missing public-cloud operations that are not registered by the simulator still require a concrete BUG and a row here when discovered by a community issue or periodic audit.

<!-- HAND-WRITTEN BEGIN -->
PR #392 added service account key CRUD (`POST/GET(single)/GET(list)/DELETE /v1/projects/{p}/serviceAccounts/{email}/keys`). The create handler generates a real RSA-2048 private key and returns it base64-encoded as a JSON credential file in `privateKeyData` (absent on get/list, matching real GCP spec). gcloud uses `project="-"` as a wildcard; the handler resolves the project by parsing the email (`{acct}@{project}.iam.gserviceaccount.com`). Tested by `simulators/gcp/sdk-tests/iam_test.go` (`TestIAM_ServiceAccountKeysCRUD`) and `simulators/gcp/cli-tests/client_surface_audit_test.go` (`TestCLI_IAMServiceAccountKeys`). Terraform does not create SA keys directly; `google_service_account_key` is not in the test stack.

`POST /v1/projects/{project}/serviceAccounts` (create) rejects a duplicate accountId within the same project with 409 `ALREADY_EXISTS` — `"Service account {accountId} already exists within project projects/{project}."` — matching real Cloud IAM instead of silently overwriting the existing account. Tested by `simulators/gcp/sdk-tests/iam_test.go` (`TestIAM_CreateServiceAccountDuplicateConflict`) and `simulators/gcp/cli-tests/iam_test.go` (`TestIAMServiceAccountCreateDuplicateCLI`). No dedicated terraform case: `google_service_account` create is idempotent by Terraform's own state tracking — a normal `apply` never issues a second raw create for a resource already in state, so the duplicate-create conflict has no terraform-provider code path to exercise.
