# Do Next

Status [STATUS.md](STATUS.md) - roadmap [PLAN.md](PLAN.md) - bugs [BUGS.md](BUGS.md) - narrative [WHAT_WE_DID.md](WHAT_WE_DID.md).

## Current State

- Branch: `main`, synced with `origin/main` after the local HTTPS gateway Stage 1 PR merged.
- Active implementation branch: none.
- Open GitHub issues at last check: none.
- Open BUG trackers: BUG-1075 and BUG-1104.
- Last completed work: optional Caddy HTTPS gateway Stage 1 for simulator APIs.

## Next Task

Wire Azure Terraform through the optional local HTTPS gateway.

The gateway already provides a realistic local HTTPS front door without changing simulator public cloud API shapes. The next proof point is Azure Terraform, because AzureRM requires trusted HTTPS for custom metadata discovery.

## Provider Facts To Preserve

- AzureRM is the hard requirement. `metadata_host` is host-only and provider source constructs `https://<host>` for custom Azure metadata discovery.
- Azure Stack is also HTTPS-shaped for ARM/metadata use.
- AzAPI exposes full endpoint URLs and defaults to HTTPS Azure endpoints; it is configurable but should work through the same gateway.
- Google Terraform provider custom endpoints are full URLs; current HTTP simulator endpoint overrides are valid and should keep working.
- AWS Terraform provider custom endpoints are full URLs; official docs explicitly support `http://localhost` service endpoints. HTTPS is optional for realism and CA-bundle coverage.
- Existing simulator direct TLS support via `SIM_TLS_CERT` / `SIM_TLS_KEY` stays. The gateway is an operator/developer front door, not a replacement for direct simulator TLS.

## Completed Gateway Stage

- Caddy config plus `make stack-https-{up,status,ca,down}` targets.
- HTTPS routes to current simulator ports:
   - `aws.sockerless.localhost` -> `127.0.0.1:4566`
   - `gcp.sockerless.localhost` -> `127.0.0.1:4567`
   - `azure.sockerless.localhost` -> `127.0.0.1:4568`
   - Azure data-plane wildcards -> Azure simulator, preserving host-addressed routing.
- `STACK_HTTPS=1` local stack integration, including Azure ARM-advertised data-plane URL projection.
- Admin UI visibility for gateway status, endpoints, CA path, and equivalent recovery `make` commands.

## Remaining Stages

1. Wire Azure Terraform first: `metadata_host`, ARM-advertised data-plane URLs, gateway CA export to Linux test containers through `SSL_CERT_FILE`.
2. Document AWS/GCP HTTPS Terraform examples while preserving direct HTTP configs.
3. Decide after local proof whether CI should use Caddy by default for Azure Terraform or keep generated direct simulator certs.

## Deferred Trackers

- BUG-1075: live-cloud validation remains deferred by user direction. Do not mark cloud cells green without authenticated real-cloud runs.
- BUG-1104: audit-cadence meta tracker remains open. Every simulator phase should audit SDK/CLI/Terraform surface claims and file concrete BUGs before fixing.

## Start Checklist

1. `git fetch origin`
2. `git checkout main`
3. `git pull origin main`
4. `gh issue list --state open --limit 30`
5. Create a fresh branch from `origin/main`.
6. File any concrete gaps in `BUGS.md` before code changes.

## Rules That Matter For This Task

- No simulator-specific public API changes.
- No mocks, fakes, or fallback modes.
- No interactive commands.
- Rebase the PR branch on `origin/main` before pushing.
- User merges PRs; never run `gh pr merge`.
