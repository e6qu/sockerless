## Where we are

Idle on `main`. PR #211 (Phase 178) merged 2026-05-25 at squash `7a7c9f0` — closed 9 community-filed issues + 5 class-of-bug remediations + 12 real-handler/shape fixes the new tf-azure CI gate surfaced.

BUGS.md: **1173 filed · 1171 fixed · 2 open · 2 false positives.** Only BUG-1075 (live-cloud, deprioritized) + BUG-1104 (audit-cadence meta) remain Open.

## Next phase trigger

Reactive only — fires when a new community-filed issue arrives or a CI regression surfaces against `main`. New work lands on `phase-179-*` per the standing single-branch / one-PR rule.

## Standing invariants (full list in STATUS.md)

- Never auto-merge; user merges every PR.
- Single-branch rule per phase; never more than 1 PR open.
- File BUGs in BUGS.md *before* any fix attempt.
- No fakes / no fallbacks / no silent shims.
- Every reopen carries a postmortem trail (`.claude/skills/reopen-postmortem/SKILL.md`).
- Every closed-enumeration surface has a `specs/SIM_SURFACE_TABLES/<name>.md` with no silent ✗ rows.
- Every List* op has a paged-iterator test (`sim-canonical-config-test` rule).
- Every stateful resource type has a state-machine assertion (`sim-state-machine-completeness`).
- `make hooks` on every fresh clone (wires `mux-overlap-scan` + gofmt + golangci-lint + …).

## Session-resume checklist

1. `git fetch origin && gh pr list --state open && git status`.
2. If a phase PR is open: `gh pr checks <N>`; report state.
3. If merged: sync `main`, delete merged branch, prune remotes, refresh continuity docs to idle.
4. If fresh issues filed: `gh issue list --state open --limit 30`; file each as a BUG in BUGS.md before any fix attempt.
5. Read `.claude/skills/avoid-vibe-slop/SKILL.md` before any code change.

## Reference for next reopen / new issue

If a community-filed issue surfaces against a closed enumeration (subresources, ops on a single service, paged List, state-bearing resource), the routine is:

1. Identify the surface table at `specs/SIM_SURFACE_TABLES/<surface>.md`. If none exists, create one before any fix.
2. File a BUG in BUGS.md citing which row(s) the issue covers + which siblings should be checked.
3. Fix the named row + every reasonable sibling (`surface-table-completeness` rule).
4. SDK test uses the canonical client (no raw `net/http` where an SDK exists; for List* use a Pager).
5. For reopens: BUG entry MUST include the three postmortem fields (what test passed but should have failed / what SDK code path was missed / what new canonical-client test catches the regression).
