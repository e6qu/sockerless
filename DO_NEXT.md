# Do Next

Status [STATUS.md](STATUS.md) - roadmap [PLAN.md](PLAN.md) - bugs [BUGS.md](BUGS.md) - narrative [WHAT_WE_DID.md](WHAT_WE_DID.md) - coverage [specs/SIM_TEST_COVERAGE_MATRIX.md](specs/SIM_TEST_COVERAGE_MATRIX.md).

## Current Branch

Branch: `bleephub-parity-storage`.

This branch is the single working branch for the Bleephub parity, durability,
storage, UI, and docs PR. Keep one PR open for this branch. Make one natural
commit per subtask, with tests and continuity docs included in the same commit.

## Current Subtask

Subtask 1: baseline Bleephub parity tests and error handling.

Start by adding focused coverage for the known fake or misleading behavior, then
fix the narrow behavior the tests prove:

- Actions cache routes in [bleephub/artifacts.go](bleephub/artifacts.go) currently
  reserve no cache, discard uploads, and always return a miss.
- The catch-all in [bleephub/server.go](bleephub/server.go) returns `200 OK` for
  unknown API paths after smart-HTTP git routing fails.
- Bleephub docs claim or imply support that is currently only shape-only for
  cache, artifact listings, Pages builds, audit log, approvals, and some GraphQL
  status fields.

First commands for the next session:

```bash
git status --short --branch
rg -n "Cache stubs|shape-only|stub|UNHANDLED REQUEST|StatusCheckRollup|hard-codes|Git storage stays" bleephub ui/packages/bleephub docs specs
cd bleephub && GOWORK=off go test ./...
```

Expected first commit shape:

```text
bleephub: replace fake cache and catch-all behavior with tracked parity gaps
```

Adjust the message to match the actual completed work. Do not mention internal
task numbering in the commit message.

## Ordered Subtasks For This PR

1. Baseline audit tests and error handling.
2. Real Actions cache behavior and artifact indexing.
3. SQLite/PostgreSQL persistence abstraction and configuration.
4. Broaden durable state for public Bleephub API objects.
5. Git storage hardening and git HTTP permission enforcement.
6. S3/MinIO-compatible git content storage.
7. UI auth and operator storage/status views.
8. UI/API coverage for cache, artifacts, webhooks, orgs/teams, branch protection,
   audit events, and repo git refs.
9. Remove or implement long-tail shape-only endpoints, then refresh all Bleephub
   docs and parity specs.
10. Final verification, rebase, push, PR creation, and local `main` sync after
    the user merges.

## Handoff Protocol

Before starting a subtask:

1. Read [STATUS.md](STATUS.md) and this file.
2. Confirm the active branch is `bleephub-parity-storage`.
3. Check `git status --short --branch`.
4. If the previous session stopped mid-subtask, inspect the modified files before
   editing anything.
5. Update this file if the next command list is no longer accurate.

After finishing a subtask:

1. Run focused tests for the touched area.
2. Run broader Bleephub tests when public API behavior changed:

```bash
cd bleephub && GOWORK=off go test ./...
cd ui/packages/bleephub && bun test
```

3. Update [STATUS.md](STATUS.md) with what changed, what was verified, and any
   remaining risk.
4. Update this file so the next session has an exact next subtask, likely files,
   and first verification command.
5. Add a short [WHAT_WE_DID.md](WHAT_WE_DID.md) entry for meaningful completed
   chunks.
6. Commit the code, tests, and continuity docs together.

## Verification State

No Bleephub implementation changes have been made on this branch yet. The last
known repository state was clean on `main` before this branch was created. Run
the Bleephub Go tests at the start of implementation to establish the local
baseline.

## Branch And PR Hygiene

- Keep one PR open for this branch.
- Before pushing the PR branch:

```bash
git fetch origin main
git rebase origin/main
```

- After pushing the branch and opening/updating the PR, return local `main` to
  the remote state after the user merges:

```bash
git checkout main
git pull origin main
```

Do not merge the PR from the agent session; the user handles merges.

## Rules That Matter Most

- No stubs, fakes, mocks, synthetic responses, discarded uploads, or silent
  fallback to memory when durable storage was requested.
- Bleephub should match real GitHub/GHES behavior for every API it exposes.
- Use official GitHub REST/OpenAPI, GraphQL, Actions cache/artifact, official
  runner behavior, and Git smart-HTTP behavior as references.
- For object storage, use a real S3-compatible client against S3/MinIO-shaped
  APIs. Do not create an in-memory object-store stand-in.
